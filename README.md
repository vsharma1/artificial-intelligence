# Artificial Intelligence Projects
My personal artificial intelligence repository for side projects /
Udacity's
[Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/artificial-intelligence-nanodegree--nd889)
program, each project contains notebook with code and a readme files.

# Projects

* [Solving a Sudoku with AI](https://github.com/vsharma1/artificial-intelligence/tree/master/AIND-Sudoku): Implement the naked twins function, and write an AI agent that will solve the Diagonal Sudoku game.
* [Build an Adversarial Search Agent](https://github.com/vsharma1/artificial-intelligence/tree/master/AIND-Isolation): Build a game-playing agent.
* [Create a Domain-Independent Planner](https://github.com/vsharma1/artificial-intelligence/tree/master/AIND-Planning): Implement a planning search.
* [Use HMMs to recognize ASL](https://github.com/vsharma1/artificial-intelligence/tree/master/AIND-Recognizer): Build a system that can recognize words communicated using the American Sign Language (ASL).
* [CNN Project: Dog Breed Classifier](https://github.com/vsharma1/artificial-intelligence/tree/master/AIND-Dog_Breed_Classifier): Build an algorithm to identify an estimate of canine breed of a given an image of a dog. If given image of a human, algorithm identifies resembling dog breed.
* [RNN Project: Time Series Predcition and Text Generation](https://github.com/vsharma1/artificial-intelligence/tree/master/AIND-RNN): Build RNNs that can generate sequences based on input data - with a focus on two applications: use real market data in order to predict future Apple stock prices using an RNN model. The second one will be trained on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's classic novel Sherlock Holmes and generates wacky sentences based on it that may - or may not - become the next great Sherlock Holmes novel.
* [Build and Alexa History Skill](https://github.com/vsharma1/artificial-intelligence/tree/master/AIND-VUI-Alexa): Build a fully functional skill for Amazon’s Alexa that provides year-dated facts from AI History (or some other History of your choosing). Through the process, you’ll get to use the Alexa Skills Kit (ASK) - a current state of the art API for building voice systems.
* [DNN Speech Recognizer](https://github.com/vsharma1/artificial-intelligence/tree/master/AIND-DNN_Speech_Recognizer): Build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) pipeline.
